                <article> <h2>Programming machines for playing chess:</h2> <section class="text-span"> past century has seen the rise of chess algorithms from theoretical designs like those of Alan Turing illustrated at <a href = "https://bletchleypark.org.uk/our-story/alan-turing-faqs/">Bletchley Park</a> -- to the heights of precision machinery mixed with game tree design of IBM to defeat Garry Kasparov -- To the lessons of these algorithms being improved by machine learning models, neural nets and <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Neural_Networks">other modern computational methods.</a>. The competition for lower cost in computation and faster more nuanced moves generated has led to many novel methods of going about these algorithms. Such as training <a href = "https://github.com/HarryMellsop/chept-2">transformer based models</a> and the fascinating results that have come from <a href = "https://medium.com/@quasimik/monte-carlo-tree-search-applied-to-letterpress-34f41c86e238"> Monte Carlo game trees. </a> 
                    Chess programming has long been a marker of human ingenuity in computational problems, as well as the development of artificial intelligence. Giving a wide array of hope to programmers around the world as programs become simpler to design and farther away from possible for a human to defeat.</section>

                <article><h2>A Brief History:</h2>
                    <section class="text-span">Originally a daunting problem faced by the modern chess programmers, how do we handle all the possible moves in chess? I’ll let you guess the amount estimated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number"> here</a> but it is far beyond the limits of even modern computers to effectively consider so many game states. Now for an early chess algorithm the goal is to work around this problem and still generate the next best move. However, for something to be the next best move it must set the gamestate in such a way that propagates future better moves. <a href = "https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?entryid=94">Claude Shannon’s  1949 paper</a> proposed a solution to this problem that influenced some of the most advanced chess algorithms today, the theoretical mini max algorithm adapted for the game of chess The algorithm was originally proposed by <a href = "https://www.jstor.org/stable/41134130"> John Von Neumann </a> and Shannon sought to seek how to implement it for the game of chess. Was the favored approach for his type A search algorithm or a brute force search algorithm because it will search all of the possible moves and there future move states to return the next best position based on the move that has the best following tree branch. Another important aspect proposed were the type B search algorithms or heuristic based selective search algorithms, ways to only search for important next best moves so as to make it computationally possible to handle generating moves in all possible game states. <a href= "https://www.chessprogramming.org/Alpha-Beta"> Alpha-Beta </a>, and algorithms inspire by its methodology make it possible today for programs to be closer to type A with aspects of type B. The ideas in this paper were being written at the same time as the   <a href = "https://www.chess.com/blog/the_real_greco/the-original-chess-engine-alan-turings-turochamp">TuroChamp </a> was developed by Alan Turing in 1948, the first verified program to generate a very good game of chess moves -- unfortunately he was not able to succeed in running this program to play through a modern computer and was only able to manually enter the moves it suggested before his death in 1954. However, His optimistic views for the future of computing have inspired all kinds of programmers today. One of the pioneers towards asking and answering the question of can computers think like humans, Turing considered the game of chess an example of something computers could excel at. The algorithms used to create the TuroChamp that were unfortunately lost to history as just another one of the developments Turing achieved --however several similar recreations have been made by his students more recently -- along with the ideas of Claude Shannon appear to  begin a thread of human ingenuity that led to today's chess engines leaving even the best human players at a loss. </section>
                    <section class="text-span">It may not sound all that impressive in the face of modern day chess programs and the methods they use but Alan Turing's program was written out on paper, such that it could be followed by a human. Decades after its creation Garry Kasparov who may go down in history as the last human to be the greatest chess player in the world (if we’re counting programs here), played several games against its recreated algorithms and recognized Turing's achievement as no less than genius. </section>
                    <section class="text-span">Before these brute force algorithms were able to be implemented on hardware that could run them to defeat the best human players in the world, they were first able to be run on vacuum-tube computers. Considered to be the first fully functional chess program the <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/The_Bernstein_Chess_Program"> Bernstein Chess Program </a> took into account the brute force search ideas like the TuroChamp and optimized the the program taking into account the developer Alex Bernsteins own knowledge of chess under the guidance of other chess experts and modern research into the game to optimize the heuristic rating of certain moves and openings as a response to the other side. However this engine would not last long in any official chess tournaments and took usually 8 minutes to estimate a move taking into account the next 4 sets of possible moves. </section>
                    <section class="text-span">For the next several decades researchers around the world sought improvements to the chess machine by implementing and improving ideas such as the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. Additionally hardware was built to specifically handle such algorithms by teams around the world. Turing and Bernstein were ultimately held back from being able to implement a chess playing machine because of hardware. Their algorithms could play great games of chess if they had infinite computing power; however even today we do not have computers that can efficiently run a program that would take into account every single possible future move in a game of chess. However due to more efficient algorithms and the leaps in hardware development that came about in the 2nd half of the 20th century; ultimately it was a team at IBM working on the project <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/deepblue/"> Deep Blue </a> who built upon these ideas and made hardware capable of being the new world champion of chess in 1997.  Although they were able to beat GM Garry Kasparov, considered the highest ranking chess player at the time, the deep blue machine which costs over $100 million to develop is trivial in game playing strength to some chess engines that could be run on most household computers and smartphones today </section> 
                    <section class="text-span">Deep Blue may have been near the peak of development for brute force searching algorithms and optimized hardware to handle them however, the exponential increasing in general computing power, more efficient game tree methods such as the monte carlo search tree  and development of functional machine learning algorithms that could be applied to chess in the 2010s has left IBM’s machine a relic of the past. </section>

                    <section class="text-span">Once we can evaluate a chess board a new challenge ensues to create the optimal chess engine. The possible next moves for a chess game tree are out of bounds for our computational possibilites to populate the tree with evaluations. Thus there is not a defined way to search for the future perfect game. Solutions to this problem have been evolving from Claude Shannon's introduction to min and max labeling for game trees. The <a href="https://philippmuens.com/minimax-and-mcts">Minimax algorithm</a> helps to simplify this search to look out for the best possibilities several moves into the future.</section>
                    <section class="text-span">This algorithm works to look at the game tree in layers, where white will go then black will go with each successive layer of next moves. Thus the maximum score move for white is likely to be taken by each white step, and the minimum score for white is likely to be taken for each black step. This works to negate moves that have a high score such as taking a queen with a queen, if the next worst move for white being taken by black would be to take whites queen.</section>
